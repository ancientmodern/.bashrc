# A Simple But Awesome Bash Terminal
This configuration is based on the great work by [KeizerDev](https://github.com/KeizerDev) on his original [.bashrc](https://github.com/KeizerDev/.bashrc) file. I adapted it to Ubuntu 22.04, reformatted it, and removed some deprecated components. All credit for the original work goes to him.

If you have any interesting and useful bash functions, don't hesitate to let me know!
